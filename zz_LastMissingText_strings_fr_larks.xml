    <!-- Got some trouble with missing text. I worked around with setting resetting primary key and renaming lang_full="Français (French)" instead of lang_full="Français". 
    I was re-setting missing text manually, shoutout to Nurver.
    still got trouble with the link menu, "pokémon" still missing. If someone manage to work around, let me know-->
